Project Planning
Lesson given on Thu 24th Aug 2017 on how to plan a software development project.
Follow that guidance here.
Lesson summary below.
 

Use AGILE develoment!
- Individuals and Interactions more than processes and tools
- Working Software more than comprehensive documentation
- Customer Collaboration more than contract negotiation
- Responding to Change more than following a plan


Requirements statement
- Split it into short sentences
- Identify nouns and verbs
- Helps find classes and methods

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Has enough features to satisfy early customers
- Provides feedback for future development

Must Should Could Would (MoSCoW)
- Must - minimum product
- Should - extension tasks
- Could - further extensions which may or may not be done, or small development tasks leading to improvement in user interface or experience
- Would / Won't - can't be done, e.g. technology limitations

Trello
- Consider using this to track the project
- Can start with MoSCoW columns!

Use Case diagrams
- Give an overview of the usage requirements of the system, and depict:
- Use cases (sequence of actions)
- Actors
- Associations
- System boundary boxes (optional)

Class diagrams
- Describe the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, attributes, methods, relationships. And should include:
- Name of each class
- Attributes of each class
- Type of each attribute
- Methods
- Relationships

Object diagrams
- Provide examples or act as test cases for class diagrams, and should include:
- Name of class (but not object!)
- Instance of the class
- Attributes of each class
- Type of each attribute, with example
- Relationships between classes

Inheritance diagrams
- Demonstrates when a child object assumes characteristics of its parent object, and should include:
- Relationships between classes, with arrow from subclass to superclass
- Focus is on flow of information between sub/superclass
- Name of classes
- Attributes of classes
- Type of each attribute

Activity diagrams
- They are flow charts representing the flow from one activity to another activity. Should include:
- Rounded rectangles with activity description
- Lines with arrows between these
- Diamonds for decisions, outgoing lines (at least 2) labelled
- bars (start/split and end/join) for concurrent activities
- black circle for start, encircled black circle for end

Implementation Constraints Plan
- Implementation constraints are things that might constrain the project and stop it from reaching its full potential
- Columns: Topic, Possible Effect of Constraint on Product, Solution
- Topic Rows: Hardware and Software platforms, Performance Requirements, Persistant storage and transactions, Usability, Budgets, Time limitations

Pseudocode
- Plan functions before even writing a line of code
- One way is to write a test but just comment in what the test should do, rather than write the functions
- Helps design the unit testing

Wireframes
- These are software (online) apps that allow you to build wireframe models of a user interface easily.
- Some options are: NinjaMock (free), MockFlow (basic free), Balsamic (30 day trial)

Sitemaps
- A list of pages at a website accessible to users
- Usually a hierarchy of rectangles
- With lines connecting them
